Project Name : Tahlily
Problem to be solved:
In Egypt, many patients—especially low- and middle-income employees—struggle to afford essential lab tests and radiology scans. Prices are unclear, bills often surprise patients, and there are no simple ways to split payments or check how much insurance will cover.
This leads many to delay or avoid diagnostics, risking their health.

Solution:
Tahlily is a digital platform focused only on lab tests and scans. It provides:

1- Transparent pricing ranges so patients know costs upfront.

2- Flexible payments through cash, cards, or BNPL installments.

3- Basic insurance estimation (later full integration).

4- Easy booking with nearby labs and centers.

Short Description:
Tahlily is a healthcare app that makes lab tests and scans more transparent, affordable, and accessible through price clarity, insurance support, and flexible payments.
